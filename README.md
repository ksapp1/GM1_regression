# Gramacidin_regression
Using multiple Machine Learning algorithms (in sci-kit learn) to determine how lipid environment impacts the hydrogen bonds that form the channel of the GM1 dimer.

This repository contains an Ipython Notebook file that takes input data on the length of the 6 hydrogen bonds in the channel and the composition and thickness are the first three lipid shells surrounding the channel, which is fit to multiple regression models to predict the continuous channel state and to get the feature importance of the membrane features in the determination of the channel state. Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) Regression models are used.
